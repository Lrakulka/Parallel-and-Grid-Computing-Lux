On GNU/Linux
1. In order to build the applications cd to build and cmake ..
2. Then use make to build everything
3. After that execute mpirun -n p ./"mpi_*", where * specifies (p - number of processes)
the program

CMake
1. cd build and cmake ..
2. command make to make executable files 
3. command make test run tests

there is an image generated by the GNU plot which is plot.jpg and plotData.txt which contains data for plot

In general

Exercise 1 is in the file mpi_circuit_sequential.c 
Exercise 3 is in the files mpi_circuit_1.c mpi_circuit_2.c mpi_circuit_3.c

Parallel_Lab1_Lux.pdf contains answers for Exercise 2 and plot of Exercise 3.3
